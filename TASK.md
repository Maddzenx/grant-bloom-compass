### Fixed Grant Details Panel Positioning - 2024-12-19
**Description**: Fixed the positioning of the grant details panel on the discovery page that was appearing underneath the navigation overlay.

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `DiscoverGrantsContent.tsx` to position the sticky details panel at `top-16` instead of `top-0`
- Adjusted panel height calculation from `h-[calc(100vh-0rem)]` to `h-[calc(100vh-4rem)]` to account for navigation bar height
- Ensures details panel appears below the navigation bar (64px height) rather than overlapping with it

**Status**: ✅ Completed
