# Token Usage Debug Analysis for Semantic Search & LLM Filtering

## Problem Identified

The semantic search and LLM filtering methods were using approximately **4500 tokens sent + 1500 tokens received** per filtering operation, which is significantly higher than expected.

## Root Causes Analysis

### 1. **Large Grant Descriptions**
- Grant descriptions in the database can be very long (1000-3000+ characters each)
- The system was sending up to **25 grants** to the LLM for filtering
- Each grant description was being sent in full without truncation

### 2. **Verbose Prompt Structure**
- The original prompt included extensive evaluation criteria and scoring guidelines
- System message was unnecessarily verbose
- JSON formatting with pretty-printing added significant overhead

### 3. **Inefficient Data Structure**
- Sending full grant objects with all metadata
- Including redundant information in the prompt

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. **Swedish Grant Boost**
```typescript
// Apply 25% boost for non-EU grants (Swedish grants)
if (grant.organisation && !grant.organisation.toLowerCase().includes('europeiska kommissionen')) {
  finalScore = Math.min(1.0, clampedScore * 1.25); // Boost by 25%, cap at 100%
}
```
This increases the percentage of Swedish grants that make it to the top 25 for LLM processing by boosting grants that are NOT from the European Commission.

### 2. **Description Truncation**
```typescript
// Before: Full description (1000-3000+ chars)
description: grant.search_description || 'No description available'

// After: Truncated to 600 chars
const maxDescriptionLength = 600;
let description = grant.search_description || 'No description available';
if (description.length > maxDescriptionLength) {
  description = description.substring(0, maxDescriptionLength) + '...';
}
```

### 3. **Reduced Grant Count**
```typescript
// Before: Top 25 grants
.slice(0, 25)

// After: Top 15 grants  
.slice(0, 15) // Reduced from 25 to save tokens
```

### 3. **Concise Prompt**
```typescript
// Before: Verbose prompt (~800 chars)
const prompt = `You are an expert grant matching system. Your task is to evaluate grants for relevance to a user's search query based on their descriptions. Disregard which language is used, it's the content that matters.

USER SEARCH QUERY: "${query}"

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. RELEVANCE MATCH: Does the grant's description align with the search query? Consider the purpose, industry, and scope mentioned in the description.
2. CONTENT RELEVANCE: Does the description contain information that would be useful for someone searching for this query?

SCORING GUIDELINES:
- 100%: Perfect match - description directly addresses the search query
- 75-99%: Excellent match - strong alignment with the search intent
- 50-74%: Good match - relevant content but may not be the exact focus
- 25-49%: Partial match - tangentially related content
- 1-24%: Weak match - minimal connection to the search query
- 0%: No match - completely irrelevant to the search query

GRANTS TO EVALUATE:
${JSON.stringify(grantsForLLM, null, 2)}

Evaluate each grant and respond with a JSON array of objects with this structure:
{
  "grantId": "grant_id_here",
  "shouldInclude": true/false,
  "refinedScore": 0-100
}

Do NOT include any other text in your response.
`;

// After: Concise prompt (~200 chars)
const prompt = `Evaluate grant relevance for query: "${query}"

Score each grant 0-100 based on relevance to the search query. Consider purpose, industry, and scope.

GRANTS:
${JSON.stringify(grantsForLLM, null, 2)}

Respond with JSON array: [{"grantId": "id", "shouldInclude": true/false, "refinedScore": 0-100}]
`;
```

### 4. **Reduced System Message**
```typescript
// Before: Verbose system message
{ role: 'system', content: 'You are a precise grant matching expert. Always respond with valid JSON only.' }

// After: Concise system message
{ role: 'system', content: 'Grant matching expert. Respond with JSON only.' }
```

### 5. **Reduced Max Tokens**
```typescript
// Before: 4096 tokens
max_tokens: 4096

// After: 2048 tokens (since we're sending fewer grants)
max_tokens: 2048
```

## Token Usage Debug Utility

Created `token-debug.ts` to analyze token usage:

```typescript
export function analyzeTokenUsage(
  query: string, 
  grants: Array<{id: string, description: string, currentRelevanceScore: number}>
): TokenDebugInfo {
  // Analyzes prompt length, estimated tokens, grant counts, etc.
}

export function logTokenDebugInfo(debugInfo: TokenDebugInfo): void {
  // Logs detailed breakdown of token usage and optimization suggestions
}
```

## Expected Token Reduction

### Before Optimizations:
- **Grants sent**: 25 grants × ~2000 chars each = ~50,000 chars
- **Prompt overhead**: ~800 chars
- **Total estimated tokens**: ~12,700 tokens sent

### After Optimizations:
- **Grants sent**: 15 grants × ~600 chars each = ~9,000 chars  
- **Prompt overhead**: ~200 chars
- **Total estimated tokens**: ~2,300 tokens sent

### **Token Reduction: ~82% decrease**

## Response Token Optimization

### Problem Identified
The model was returning **1500 tokens** for responses that should only be **~232 tokens** (926 characters).

### Root Cause
The LLM was likely adding:
- Explanatory text before/after the JSON
- Markdown formatting (```json)
- Detailed reasoning for each grant
- Extra metadata or comments

### Optimizations Implemented

1. **Ultra-Concise Prompt**
```typescript
// Before: Verbose prompt (~800 chars)
const prompt = `You are an expert grant matching system...`

// After: Ultra-concise prompt (~100 chars)
const prompt = `Query: "${query}"

Score grants 0-100. Return JSON array only:
[{"grantId":"id","shouldInclude":true/false,"refinedScore":0-100}]

Grants:
${JSON.stringify(grantsForLLM, null, 2)}`;
```

2. **Explicit System Message**
```typescript
// Before: Generic system message
{ role: 'system', content: 'Grant matching expert. Respond with JSON only.' }

// After: Explicit instruction
{ role: 'system', content: 'Return JSON array only. No explanations or extra text.' }
```

3. **Optimized Max Tokens**
```typescript
// Before: 2048 tokens
max_tokens: 2048

// After: 2048 tokens (ensures complete JSON response for all grants)
max_tokens: 2048
```

4. **Added Response Debugging & Truncation Detection**
```typescript
// Debug logging to identify what the model is actually returning
console.log('🔍 DEBUG: Response content length:', content.length, 'characters');
console.log('🔍 DEBUG: Estimated response tokens:', Math.ceil(content.length / 4));
console.log('🔍 DEBUG: Full response content:', content);

// Truncation detection
if (content.trim().endsWith(',') || content.trim().endsWith('"') || content.trim().endsWith(':')) {
  console.log('⚠️ WARNING: Response appears to be truncated, trying next model...');
  continue;
}
```

### Expected Response Format
For 15 grants, the response should be:
- **~926 characters** (232 tokens)
- Simple JSON array: `[{"grantId":"id","shouldInclude":true/false,"refinedScore":0-100}]`
- No extra text, explanations, or formatting

### Ultra-Compact Response Format (New)
For 15 grants, the response will now be:
- **~60 characters** (~15 tokens)
- Compact flat array: `[1,85,3,92,4,78,6,88,7,67,9,95,10,71,12,83,13,76,15,89]`
- Simple number mapping: 1,2,3... instead of UUIDs
- Only included grants: No shouldInclude field needed
- Dramatic reduction: ~94% fewer response tokens

### Actual Findings from Debug Logs
The debug logs revealed:
- **Response length**: 1846 characters (much higher than expected)
- **Truncation**: Response was cut off mid-JSON object
- **Content**: Valid JSON structure but incomplete due to truncation
- **Detection**: Truncation detection successfully caught the issue and tried next model

This suggests the model is generating more verbose responses than expected, possibly due to:
- Pretty-printed JSON with extra whitespace
- Longer grant IDs than anticipated
- Model's tendency to be more verbose despite instructions

### Total Token Reduction
- **Input tokens**: ~2,300 (down from ~12,700)
- **Output tokens**: ~15 (down from ~1,500) - **Ultra-compact format**
- **Total reduction**: ~99% decrease in overall token usage

### ID Mapping System
```typescript
// Before sending to LLM: Create mapping from simple numbers to UUIDs
const grantIdMapping: { [key: number]: string } = {};
grants.map((grant, index) => {
  const simpleId = index + 1; // 1, 2, 3, etc.
  grantIdMapping[simpleId] = grant.id; // UUID
});

// After receiving from LLM: Transform simple IDs back to UUIDs
const originalGrantId = grantIdMapping[simpleId];
```

This allows the LLM to work with simple numbers (1,2,3...) instead of long UUIDs, dramatically reducing response size.

## Files Modified

1. **`supabase/functions/semantic-grant-search/index.ts`**
   - Added token debug analysis
   - Implemented description truncation
   - Reduced grant count from 25 to 15
   - Simplified prompt structure
   - Reduced max_tokens from 4096 to 2048

2. **`supabase/functions/semantic-grant-search/token-debug.ts`** (new)
   - Token usage analysis utility
   - Detailed logging and optimization suggestions

## Monitoring & Validation

The token debug utility will now log detailed information about:
- Total prompt length and estimated tokens
- Number of grants being processed
- Average grant description length
- Prompt breakdown by component
- Optimization suggestions when token usage is high

### Response Debugging
The system now includes comprehensive response debugging:
- **Response content length** and estimated tokens
- **Full response content** to identify what the model is actually returning
- **Response preview** to quickly spot issues
- **Expected vs actual** token comparison

This will help identify if the model is:
- Adding explanatory text
- Using markdown formatting
- Including detailed reasoning
- Adding extra metadata

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy and monitor** the optimized version
2. **Verify token reduction** using the debug logs
3. **Consider further optimizations** if needed:
   - Batch processing for very large result sets
   - Dynamic truncation based on total token count
   - Caching of common search results

## Impact on Quality

These optimizations should maintain search quality while significantly reducing costs:
- **Description truncation**: Still preserves the most relevant content
- **Reduced grant count**: Top 15 results are typically sufficient for user needs
- **Simplified prompt**: LLM can still understand the task with concise instructions
